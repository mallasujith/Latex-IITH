Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to set up SSH keys and use them for pushing code to GitHub:

### Step 1: Generate an SSH Key

1. Open your terminal.

2. Generate a new SSH key pair:
   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Replace `your_email@example.com` with your GitHub email address.

3. When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default location.

4. When prompted, enter a secure passphrase (optional but recommended).

### Step 2: Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

1. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:
   ```sh
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   This will display your public key in the terminal. Copy the entire key (starting with `ssh-ed25519` and ending with your email).

2. Go to GitHub and log in to your account.

3. In the upper-right corner, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.

4. In the left sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.

5. Click **New SSH key**.

6. In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key. For example, "My Laptop SSH Key".

7. Paste your key into the "Key" field.

8. Click **Add SSH key**.

### Step 3: Configure Git to Use SSH

1. Open your terminal.

2. Verify that your SSH key is added to the SSH agent:
   ```sh
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

3. Test your SSH connection to GitHub:
   ```sh
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   You should see a message like "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access."

### Step 4: Update the Remote URL to Use SSH

1. In your terminal, navigate to your project directory:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Update the remote URL to use SSH:
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:mallasujith/FWC-IITH.git
   ```

### Step 5: Push Your Code

1. Push your code to GitHub using SSH:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Complete Workflow Example

1. **Generate SSH Key**:
   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**:
   - Copy the key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to GitHub settings and add the key.

3. **Configure SSH Agent**:
   ```sh
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

4. **Update Remote URL**:
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:mallasujith/FWC-IITH.git
   ```

5. **Push Code**:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```

By following these steps, you can set up SSH authentication and push your code to GitHub securely and without the need for a Personal Access Token or password.
